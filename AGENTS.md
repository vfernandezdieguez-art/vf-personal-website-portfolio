# AGENTS Rules

These rules are mandatory for every change in this repository.

1. Code must always be written in English.
2. Use minimal comments; only add comments when they explain non-obvious logic.
3. Before changing UI, read `src/app/components/ui-kit.tsx` and follow `guidelines/UI-KIT.md` as the source of truth.
4. Respect the existing grids and spacing system.
5. When asked to run the repo, always fix whatever prevents it from running. This repo is frequently overwritten from Figma Make exports, so runtime issues must be repaired as part of that request.
